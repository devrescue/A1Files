# Postgres Integration with Jupyter Notebook

Postgres or PostgreSQL (pronounced _post-gress_ and _post-greh-sequel_ respectively) is a free and open source object-relational database management system. It's very similar to traditional RDBMS systems such as SQL Server and MySQL except that it includes Object Oriented concepts and modelling in its architecture and functionality. Postgres was ranked the number one most popular database among professional developers in the [2022 Stack Overflow Developer Survey](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2022/#most-popular-technologies-database-prof "Go To Survey") .

Jupyter Notebook is a web application that combines live code, data and visualizations into interactive, dynamic documents called _notebooks_.

What you will learn in this article is how to use Jupyter Notebook to query, manipulate and seamlessly integrate data from a PostgreSQL database into a Data Science workflow. Your notebook will contain the live code that will perform the workflow tasks as well as any graphs, charts, exposition and commentary.

This is the plan of action you will follow:

- Set Up Environment and Load Sample Data
- Connect to Postgres from Jupyter Notebook
- Perform Data Wrangling and Exploratory Analysis of the Sample Data

---

## Set Up Environment and Load Sample Data

The first step would be to prepare the environment. You will need to have the following up and running on your workstation before moving forward:

- PostgreSQL 14.3 (or recent version)
- Jupyter Notebook (recent version with Python and R support)

### PostgreSQL Set Up

PostgreSQL is compatible with most popular operating systems so it shouldn't matter what you decide to use. You can download PostgreSQL for your OS at the [official site](https://www.postgresql.org/download/linux/ubuntu/ "Go To Page"). Consult the [documentation and instructions](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/14/index.html "Go To Page") for your version if you get stuck setting it up.

For this article, the [World Health Statistics 2020 dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/utkarshxy/who-worldhealth-statistics-2020-complete "Go To Page") will be used. It was originally posted on Kaggle but a small subset of this data is available at [this Github repo](https://github.com/devrescue/postgres-sampledb "Go To Repo") for easy import into Postgres. Alternatively, you can adapt the upcoming example code to use whatever data you want.

If you are using the sample data, clone the repo to your workstation and edit the CSV locations in the _import.sql_ file to point to the absolute paths. On Ubuntu (22.04) importing the data would then be as simple as running the following commands at the Terminal:

```shell
sudo -i -u postgres psql -c "CREATE DATABASE \"sampledb\";"
sudo -i -u postgres psql -d sampledb < create_tables.sql
sudo -i -u postgres psql -d sampledb < import.sql
```

The first command creates the _sampledb_ database. The second command creates the schema and tables and the third copies the rows from the CSV files into the database tables.

### Jupyter Notebook Set Up

Next, ensure that Jupyter Notebook is installed and functional. Reference the [installation instructions](https://jupyter.org/install "Go To Page") for more details but it's usually as simple as running the following command at the terminal:

```shell
pip install notebook
```

And you launch it with:

```shell
jupyter notebook
```

Installing Jupyter Notebook will also install the _IPython Kernel_. A _kernel_ is what Jupyter Notebook uses to provide programming language support. The _IPython Kernel_ provides support for Python programming language notebooks via _IPython_, the enhanced interactive Python shell.

When you launch Jupyter Notebook you should see the following options under _New_. This will change shortly when we add R programming language support:

-->

Quit Jupyter Notebook and install the [psycopg PostgreSQL database adapter](https://www.psycopg.org/docs/install.html#quick-install "Go To Page") for Python with the following command. This is very important:

```shell
pip install psycopg2-binary
```

Next install the [IPython SQL extension](https://github.com/catherinedevlin/ipython-sql "Go To Repo") which will allow you to use SQL commands from within Jupyter Notebook. The command to install is:

```shell
pip install ipython-sql
```

This article will also make use of the R programming language kernel to create R notebooks that connect to Postgres. This kernel is usually not installed by default.

To install the R Kernel, first install the R programming language. Find the instructions to do so for your OS on the [official site](https://cran.r-project.org/ "Go To Page"). On Ubuntu 22.04 you can use this command at the terminal:

```shell
sudo apt-get install r-base
```

Then launch the R command line tool by simply typing the letter R, uppercase:

```shell
$ R

R version 4.1.2 (2021-11-01) -- "Bird Hippie"
Copyright (C) 2021 The R Foundation for Statistical Computing
...
'help.start()' for an HTML browser interface to help.
Type 'q()' to quit R.

>
```

Before installing the kernel, two key prequisites needed will be the _libpq-dev_ and _libpq5_ PostgreSQL C client library packages. According to [to this repo](https://github.com/ncbi/python-libpq-dev "Go To Repo") it is currently being built only for Linux, unfortunately. You can install it like this on Ubuntu 22.04 using _apt_:

```shell
sudo apt-get install libpq-dev
```

If that command fails you should get an error message like this:

```shell
$ sudo apt-get install libpq-dev
.....

The following packages have unmet dependencies:
 libpq-dev : Depends: libpq5 (= 14.4-0ubuntu0.22.04.1) but 14.4-1.pgdg22.04+1 is to be installed
E: Unable to correct problems, you have held broken packages.
```

In which case you should take note of the missing dependency and issue this new command that addresses the missing dependency. You should modify this to match your specific situation. After that, you then reissue the original command:

```shell
sudo apt-get install libpq5=14.4-0ubuntu0.22.04.1
sudo apt-get install libpq-dev
```

Now install the [R Kernel for Jupyter Notebook](https://irkernel.github.io/ "Go To Page"). Consult the [installation guide](https://irkernel.github.io/installation/ "Go To Page") for further instructions but you may use these commands at the R command prompt/console:

```R
install.packages('IRkernel')
IRkernel::installspec()
```

The first command installs the kernel itself and the second makes it available to Jupyter Notebook

Finally, you will add the the third package which installs the important [RPostgreSQL Package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/RPostgreSQL/index.html "Go To Page") so R can communicate with Postgres.

```R
install.packages('RPostgreSQL')
```

Now, when you launch Jupyter Notebook again you should see the following:

## Connect to Postgres from Jupyter Notebook

With the environment now prepared, you can now create your first notebook.
